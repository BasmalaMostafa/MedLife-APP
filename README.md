# MedLife-APP
 This is my Graduation project and i work on it with my GP team.

 # Project Description
 To overcome the prominent limitations of Egyptian pharmacy apps, we propose building a
 user-friendly application “MedLife” for selling/purchasing drugs, vitamins, medications,
 and other products, but more importantly for making the experience of users better. It
 will also facilitate the process of registering pharmacies in any location and becoming
 part of the system. Furthermore, MedLife will take the competition to a whole new level by
 applying machine learning and deep learning for time series forecasting of drug sales.
 That way, our app not only allows pharmacists to track the sales of products, but also
 access drug sales predictions geographically. For example, a pharmacy in Cairo can know
 which drugs are going to be the most sold drugs in the next month. Also, we offer a
 solution for users who 3 might find it difficult to read prescriptions by building an OCR
 reader that will read the prescription and tell them the drugs’ names directly.

 # Technologies Used
  The mobile application is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, combined with the BLoC (Business Logic Component) state management pattern. Flutter,Hive ,DIO ,Rest API , a cross-platform development framework, was chosen to ensure the app's functionality on multiple platforms. The primary focus of the mobile app is to facilitate interactions between patients and pharmacists.
